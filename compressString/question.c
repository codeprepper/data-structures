/**
 * problem:
 *      Compress a given string by replacing consecutive repeating characters
 *      with the character followed by its frequency. If the resulting string
 *      is longer than the original, return the original string itself.
 * examples:
 *      aaabbbc => a3b3c1
 *      aaaaaa  => a6
 *      aabbcc  => aabbcc (a2b2c2 is not shorter)
 * complexity:
 *      time  = ?
 *      space = ?
