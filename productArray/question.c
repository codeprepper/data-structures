/**
 * problem:
 *      Given an input array A, return a product array B such that each element
 *      in B is the product of all elements in A except the element at the same
 *      index in A. The required time complexity is O(N) and you are NOT
 *      allowed to use the division operator.
 *
 * examples:
 *      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]
 *
 * complexity:
 *      time = O(N)
 *      space = O(N)
