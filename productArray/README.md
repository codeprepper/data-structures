Problem
-------
Given an input array A, return a product array B such that each element in B is
the product of all elements of A except the element at the same index in A. The
required time complexity is O(N) and you are not allowed to use the division
operator.

Example
-------
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]

Complexity
----------
- Time : O(N)
- Space: O(N)

Instructions
------------
1. Complete the required APIs in `question.c` to attempt this question.
2. Please don't edit the function prototype provided in `question.c`, your
 . solution might not compile if you do.
3. If you need hints to solve the problem, look at `hints.c` instead.
4. When you're done, compile your changes by running: `make all`
5. Test your code using: `./question < input.txt` or `./hints < input.txt`.
6. The solution is available in `answer.c` (compile using: `make answer`)
7. Get the expected output using: `./answer < input.txt`
8. Feel free to include any additional header files or define additional
  functions.
